    "<b>Submission method</b>: see LMS\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Submission materials</b>: completed copy of this iPython notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Late submissions</b>: -20% per day\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Marks</b>: 7% of mark for class (with 6% on correctness + 1% on quality and efficiency of your code)\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Materials</b>: See the main class LMS page for information on the basic setup required for this class, including an iPython notebook viewer and the python packages NLTK, Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib and Scikit-Learn. In particular, if you are not using a lab computer which already has it installed, we recommend installing all the data for NLTK, since you will need various parts of it to complete this assignment. You can also use any Python built-in packages, but do not use any other 3rd party packages; if your iPython notebook doesn't run on the marker's machine, you will lose marks. <b> You should use Python 3</b>. \n",
    "\n",
    "To familiarize yourself with NLTK, here is a free online book:  Steven Bird, Ewan Klein, and Edward Loper (2009). <a href=http://nltk.org/book>Natural Language Processing with Python</a>. O'Reilly Media Inc. You may also consult the <a href=https://www.nltk.org/api/nltk.html>NLTK API</a>.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Evaluation</b>: Your iPython notebook should run end-to-end without any errors in a reasonable amount of time, and you must follow all instructions provided below, including specific implementation requirements and instructions for what needs to be printed (please avoid printing output we don't ask for). You should edit the sections below where requested, but leave the rest of the code as is. You should leave the output from running your code in the iPython notebook you submit, to assist with marking. The amount each section is worth is given in parenthesis after the instructions. \n",
    "\n",
    "You will be marked not only on the correctness of your methods, but also the quality and efficency of your code: in particular, you should be careful to use Python built-in functions and operators when appropriate and pick descriptive variable names that adhere to <a href=\"https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/\">Python style requirements</a>. If you think it might be unclear what you are doing, you should comment your code to help the marker make sense of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Updates</b>: Any major changes to the assignment will be announced via LMS. Minor changes and clarifications will be announced in the forum on LMS, we recommend you check the forum regularly.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Academic Misconduct</b>: For most people, collaboration will form a natural part of the undertaking of this homework, and we encourge you to discuss it in general terms with other students. However, this ultimately is still an individual task, and so reuse of code or other instances of clear influence will be considered cheating. We will be checking submissions for originality and will invoke the Universityâ€™s <a href=\"http://academichonesty.unimelb.edu.au/policy.html\">Academic Misconduct policy</a> where inappropriate levels of collusion or plagiarism are deemed to have taken place."

Firstly, you will preprocess the dataset to filter out the rare and ambiguous words.

    "Instructions: For this homework we will be comparing our methods against a popular dataset of word similarities called Similarity-353. You need to first obtain this dataset, which is available on LMS. The file we will be using is called set1.tab. Make sure you save this in the same folder as the notebook. Except for the header (which should be stripped out), the file is tab formated with the first two columns corresponding to two words, and the third column representing a human-annotated similarity between the two words. You should ignore the subsequent columns.\n",

    "You should load this file into a Python dictionary (NOTE: in Python, tuples of strings, i.e. (\"tiger\",\"cat\") can serve as the keys of a dictionary to map to their human-annotated similarity). This dataset contains many rare words: we need to filter this dataset in order for it to be better suited to the resources we will use in this assignment. So your first goal is to filter this dataset to generate a smaller test set where you will evaluate your word similarity methods.\n",
    "The first filtering is based on document frequencies in the Brown corpus, in order to remove rare words. In this homework, we will be treating the paragraphs of the Brown corpus as our \"documents\". You can iterate over them by using the paras method of the corpus reader. You should remove tokens that are not alphabetic. Tokens should be lower-cased and lemmatized. Now calculate document frequencies for each word type, and use this to remove from your word similarity data any word pairs where at least one of the two words has a document frequency of less than 8 in this corpus.\n",
    "For this part, you should store all the word pair and similarity mappings in your filtered test set in a dictionary called filtered_gold_standard. You may check the section, \"For your testing\", below for the expected filtered_gold_standard.\n",

We define single primary sense here as either a) having only one sense (i.e. only one synset), or b) where the count (as provided by the WordNet `count()` method for the lemmas associated with a synset) of the most common sense is at least 4 times larger than the next most common sense. Note that a synset can be associated with multiple lemmas. You should only consider the count of your lemma. Also, you should remove any words where the primary sense is not a noun (this information is also in the synset).
